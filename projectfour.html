<h1><b>Final Project</b></h1>
<p><b>About the Project: For my final project, I decided to try and improve upon my third project, which was the crappy arc reactor. Overall, I feel like I was pretty successful with the additions that I made. I attatched the circuitboard to a shirt and created buttons out of pennies and copper wire to make the interface more accessible and eaier to use. I also made the circuitboard light up blue when activated as well.</b>  </p>
