  <p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
    My artwork focuses on nostalgia, particularly nostalgia surrounding technology. I often find myself reminiscing about technologies, games, and the internet that I grew up with in the late 2000s and early 2010s and incorporate aspects of them into my art. I also tend to find myself incorporating aspects of the internet and technology that was slightly before my time into my art as well. The sad feeling of nostalgia that is evoked from experiencing something from your past or a time before you, like you are reaching for something that you will never fully experience ever again. This is the type of feeling I get when I look at my own art and try to evoke not only in myself, but my audience as well, through the imagery and narrative of my pieces. 
    I have been greatly influenced by other projects that focus on older aspects of the internet. One of my biggest influences is Cameronâ€™s World. This large collection of old gifs and images from games and websites spanning across internet history evoke a great feeling of nostalgia for the viewer. I hope to evoke a similar feeling with my work, not just through images, but also through the narratives I create with them. I feel a sense of nostalgia when I look at digital projects like that that emulate certain aspects of gaming, technology, and the internet that have been lost to time. I want to evoke similar feelings through the art I make. However, I also really like storytelling and like to combine these two ideas together. I mainly focus on digital artwork, as most of my source material comes from the digital world. In the past, I have manipulated pieces of old internet history and technology into games and websites by using programs such as Adobe Dreamweaver and basic html code. As I continue to explore different programs and mediums, I hope to become more successful in bringing my visions to life.
